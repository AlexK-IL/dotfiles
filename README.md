# Dotfiles
This repository conatins my personal dotfiles, I'm using symbolic links to help me keep the repository updated.

I'm using the linux distro: [archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/).

The file [installed_programs.txt](../blob/master/installed_programs.txt) is the output of: `pacman -Qe >> installed_programs.txt`.

All files are in their original location on my machine, for example the file `/home/alex/.xinitrc` is on the same location on my computer.
